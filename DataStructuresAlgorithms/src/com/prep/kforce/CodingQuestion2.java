/**
 * A string is said to be beautiful if each letter in the string appears at most as many times as the previous letter
 * in the alphabet within the string; ie: b occurs no more times than a; c occurs no more times than b; etc.
 * Note that letter a has no previous letter.
 *
 * Given a string, check whether it is beautiful.
 *
 * Example
 *
 * For inputString = "bbbaacdafe", the output should be solution(inputString) = true.
 * This string contains 3 as, 3 bs, 1 c, 1 d, 1 e, and 1 f (and 0 of every other letter), so since there aren't any
 * letters that appear more frequently than the previous letter, this string qualifies as beautiful.
 *
 * For inputString = "aabbb", the output should be solution(inputString) = false.
 * Since there are more bs than as, this string is not beautiful.
 *
 * For inputString = "bbc", the output should be solution(inputString) = false.
 * Although there are more bs than cs, this string is not beautiful because there are no as,
 * therefore there are more bs than as.

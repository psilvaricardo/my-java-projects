     * the instance for that object itself.
     *
     * It works just like you would expect it to from an anonymous inner class,
     * but it doesn't quite work that way for a lambda expression.
     *
     * This is, among some other things, a true indication that a lambda expression
     * is not really a syntactical sugar around anonymous inner classes, but it's
     * that it is its own thing...
